# Deploying an Auto-Scaling Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) with Terraform

## This project demonstrates Infrastructure as Code on Microsoft Azure by using Terraform to provision a Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) with auto-scaling and then integrating a full cost, linting, and security pipeline in a Linux environment. After deploying the infrastructure, I estimated and compared cloud costs with Infracost, enforced coding standards with TFLint, and detected misconfigurations and policy violations using TFSec with both default and custom checks, creating a repeatable, production-style workflow for provisioning, validating, securing, and estimating the cost of scalable compute resources in Azure.
